## Description

A [Nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) boilerplate based on the Typescript starter repository.

It utilizes graphql and typeORM.

The graphql schema gets generated by type-graphql, so no need to write any gql files.

Because of the combination of type-graphql and typeorm, you can use the same models as base for your database schema and your graphql schema.

This boilerplate features a complete authentication system with:

* Register mutation
* Login query
* user model
* authentication guards


This project is configured to use sqlite as default database, but it will work with any db supported by nest (check the documentation)


The authenticated user gets passed to the context, so it is available in every resolver method.

Graphql playground for testing queries and mutations is running on /graphql

A tutorial on how to use this will be coming soon...
